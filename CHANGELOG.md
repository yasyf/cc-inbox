# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The running daemon refreshes registered markdown imports and new archive
  files every 2 seconds, so ingestion no longer depends on plugin tool calls.
  The `PostToolUse` hook continues to refresh imports after each matching call.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Deploy stack, target, lane, board, PR, and build references; repeatable
  environments; release mode, outcome, commit, and census fields.
- `blocked`, `unblock`, and `review` kinds, plus `--resolves` to close an open
  item from any later record. Defects now remain open until closed.
- Stack, target, and PR filters for CLI reads and HTTP records and streams;
  computed opener status on JSON tail, grep, watch, and HTTP records reads.
- `/v1/lanes?drive=` for each lane's latest record by time, including expired
  records, and import extraction of stack tokens, PRs, and Buildkite build URLs.
- `cci serve` now ensures a daemonkit daemon (`com.yasyf.cc-inbox`) that serves
  the HTTP API at `127.0.0.1:7377` from a long-lived store, and returns. Writes
  and CLI reads stay direct to SQLite and need no daemon.

### Changed

- Schema 3 migrates `refs.pr` to `refs.prs`, `refs.build` to `refs.builds`, and
  `fields.env` to `fields.envs`, and merges the old `fields.stack` PR list into
  `refs.prs`. `--stack` now takes `<project>/<env>`; use repeated `--pr` for PRs.
- README and plugin guidance cover stack queries, explicit resolution, and
  `--to owner` for work that needs the owner.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- `cci` CLI for typed drive coordination records in a local SQLite store.
- Kind validation, a 400-character text limit, typed references and fields,
  expiry, duplicate detection, and open-item pairing.
- Session drive bindings, root prompt capture, and named read cursors that
  resume after the last printed record. New tail cursors read the past hour.
- Bounded tail and regex search, Monitor watches with a 29-minute default
  lifetime, and digests that list open items in their window and count older ones.
- Incremental markdown import with source-line deduplication, file offsets, and
  blob references for long bodies.
- Daily compaction that preserves still-open items.
- Store isolation through the `CCI_HOME` environment variable.
- Read-only HTTP endpoints for drives, records, digests, and server-sent events.
- Claude Code marketplace plugin with `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and
  `PostToolUse` hooks, plus the `using-cci` skill.
